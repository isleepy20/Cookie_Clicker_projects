# Cookie Bakery – Ascension Tree (Web Demo)

A small **Cookie Clicker**‑style game that includes:

* click‑to‑bake cookies  
* buildings that generate CPS (cookies‑per‑second)  
* upgrades & achievements  
* a **dark‑cosmic “Ascension Tree”** where you spend Heavenly Chips (HC) on permanent upgrades  
* auto‑save, prestige/ascension, golden‑cookie events, and a particle‑style background (pure JS/CSS)

The whole UI runs in the browser – there is no server‑side logic required.  
A minimal ASP.NET Core host (`Program.cs`) is supplied only so you can launch the
site with `dotnet run` while keeping the same folder layout you would use for a static
website.
